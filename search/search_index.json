I was very lucky to find a captivating career that was interesting and creative, two things that have always been very important to me.</p> <p>After finishing my design career, I joined a scholarship at a local institution that opened a world of opportunities for design for me. I got to work on different types of projects, from paper flyers to complicated web design projects. I was able to try on a lot of different challenges and some of them are still used to this very day.</p> <p>Later on, in my Master's Degree, I discovered responsive web design, UX, UI, and HCI design fields, and I fell in love with the ability to make products that are never actually finished, nor done, but can be only improved by investigation and testing. I love that part of digital product design, and I decided to pursue it as my main focus.</p> <p>I truly believe that nothing is impossible.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"about/#design-philosophy-and-style","title":"Design Philosophy and Style","text":"<p>My design philosophy is based on the idea that design should be fun, functional, and user-centric. I believe that design should solve problems, enhance experiences, and create value for both the users and the clients. I also believe that design should be simple, but not simplistic, and that every element should have a purpose and a meaning.</p> <p>My design style is influenced by my industrial design background, where I learned to appreciate the beauty and elegance of minimalism, geometry, and contrast. I also like to experiment with vivid and saturated colors, and to add some originality and personality to my work. I admire designers who can combine functionality, simplicity, and power in their work, such as Dieter Rams, Jony Ive, and Paula Scher.</p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"about/#fun-stuff","title":"Fun stuff","text":"<p>My geeky nature and stubborness enhance my problem-solving skills, bringing a unique perspective and insatiable curiosity to each project.

One of my recent achievements was mastering the ability to make Neapolitan pizzas at home for parties, and they were a huge success.</li> <li>Reading:       I love to read books that enrich my design knowledge and help me understand better human actions. I love everything related to psychology, neuroscience, and behavioural psychology. I enjoy reading and listening to audiobooks on those themes.</li> <li>Travelling:      Since I don\u2019t live in the same country as my parents and relatives, I travel to visit and keep in touch with them. I also love to travel and to discover new places, cultures, and people. Traveling also helps me to broaden my horizons, to appreciate diversity, and to challenge myself.

It provokes conflict with stakeholders and the development team. We needed to close a prototype version with the same pace as our releases. Each one of those files needed to be available for search, allowing us to consult changes and when were they applied. This is exactly how it gets a little bit tricky.

I have been longing to get to it and I finally did.</p> <p>There were a couple of things I had to get used to at my new position. The first and very important, integrate in a development team that has not had a designer for a very long time. I had to learn a lot about the project we are developing, who is doing what, who to talk to when I have a specific question, etc\u2026</p> <p>When people go to work in an office, there usually is no habit of documenting everything, every decision that was taken, reasons why, etc \u2026 and this place was no different.

Although, this was all new for me, from the experience I previously had, I felt like in my own waters there.</p> <p>A couple of months later when I felt that I knew my way around and got a little more confident in my new position, I made the first request for Work From Home in the company\u2019s calendar. I got almost an immediate response: \u201cOK\u201d. I said: \u201cWait a minute, is that all that it takes? I will definitely do it again.\u201d After that he day came and I took my laptop, connected my home screen to it and started working from my home desk.</p> <p>Well, I don\u2019t really remember what I did that day, but I remember the feeling of a dream just getting a big fat green checkmark.</p> <p>You see, around four years ago, I was working on a project of developing a base theme for twelve different websites, using a local server for development and another one for production. The themes had the same base structure, but had some differences, so all of this had to be managed, developed and maintained and I had the best document ever to guide me how to do it. Everything that was changed manually and to watch for when updates were coming and so on. I got a little carried away here, but my point is, around this time, I started thinking that something basic is wrong there and after a little while I came to the conclusion that what I was actually doing was crossing half an island (60km back and forth) to go to the office and connect to a server, maintain myself busy and then get on a car again, and head home. Around that time, I had a little boy, he was a little over 2 years old, and it was very interesting seeing him discovering simple things. So, I made a simple count and the two hours I am spending on the road everyday are taking ten hours per week from me seeing this little boy growing.</p> <p>Well, nothing is that simple, but the fact is, there is no sense of me being present in an office, if I am going to be much happier staying a couple of days a week and work from home. It saves energy in the morning, saves gasoline and, frankly, two hours of my day. It made me look for opportunities, but again around 2015, there were some remote companies, but nothing like what we have nowadays. There a couple of sites where you can go to, register and start experiencing on your own, see if you actually like it. There was nothing there when I started thinking about it. There were some lucky people posting how cool it is to work remotely and don\u2019t depend on a physical environment. I don\u2019t remember exactly when, but sure enough, Automattic closed their office and it got a lot of press around the world, I remember thinking to myself that day: \u201cjust how lucky these people are!\u201d. I went on doing my job, crossing the island and waiting for something new and interesting to appear. Well, it\u2019s been some time, but it is actually happening now.</p> <p>Remote work is way more attractive for me and I hope more companies will realise that and help their people stay happier and more productive, enjoying the work and their lives.</p> <p>I am very grateful for my current position, where I can ask for a remote day and just get it. It comes very helpful when my son has a cold and need to stay around to give him medicine. Although, he is not so little now, I still enjoy his presence a lot and I am very happy to have him around while I am actually at work, resolving my everyday jira tasks.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2019/11/podcasts-i-listen/","title":"Podcasts to listen","text":"<p>This year has definitely been discovering podcasts for me.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2019/11/podcasts-i-listen/#in-english","title":"In English","text":"<p>Well, since there has always been more content in English than any other language over the internet.
