## Work at Hand

A well-known local brand of shoe stores decided to enter into the online market. Initially, there was a well-established warehouse management system with a connection through the database. The dates for new collection releases were set, and the latest models were chosen in line with seasonal trends.

However, what was lacking was material for creating publications and social media posts. There was no product photography beyond what the brands produced for their social media. Utilizing these materials wouldn't make the shoe store brand recognizable or remarkable. Early on, we decided to create unique material to promote the trendiest products independently from the manufacturers.

Lacking a model for the shoes, I had to get creative and started creating different compositions by type, size, and color to make them appealing and interesting. Surprisingly, it worked out well, and our following began to grow steadily.

After that period, we were able to secure a model for the shoes, and naturally, the quality of our photo shoots improved a lot.

### My Unique Contribution to the Project

- Creation of the Content Calendar
- Inventing a post style for each social media channel
- Programming for the release of each posts
- Building and maintaining relashionships with our clients

Some of the shoe compositions from our images were reposted by the brands manufacturers and gained significant interest on their social media profiles.

## The takeaways

I worked at the company's head office, which maintained constant communication with the warehouse and the development team responsible for connecting the physical warehouse platform to the online sales platform. We were all in constant communication, planning, and managing every task meticulously to ensure everything was done at the right moment.

## Did this work experience improve my career?

Absolutely! I learned how to manage a relatively large database of physical products, create a content calendar, and post engaging content on social media. I witnessed continuous growth in our social following and had direct contact with clients, which was very important to me.

These images represent only a small part of what I accomplished during my time there.
